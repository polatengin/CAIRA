# Azure AI Foundry - Basic Private Configuration

This Terraform configuration deploys a baseline Azure AI Foundry environment designed for development and experimentation with AI workloads, without exposing them to the public internet. It provides a simple, cost-effective setup that includes all essential components for building, testing, and monitoring AI applications via private endpoints.

## Overview

The Basic AI Foundry configuration creates a minimal but complete AI development environment in a private network suitable for:

- **Generative AI POC Development**: Building custom copilots, chatbots, and AI-powered applications
- **Model Experimentation**: Testing and fine-tuning AI models in a controlled environment
- **Learning and Training**: Educational environments for teams new to Azure AI services

**NOTE**: While the Azure AI Foundry endpoints will be private, if you are using AI Agent Service, its endpoints will be running in a VNET managed by Microsoft and potentially with other tenants. If you want complete isolation for your AI Agents as well, we recommend you use the [foundry_standard_private](../foundry_standard_private/README.md) reference architecture.

Foundry-only use case: If you are not planning to use the Agent Service, this basic architecture (or its public networking counterpart) is recommended; the standard architectures add agent-focused dependent resources (Cosmos DB, Storage, AI Search) you can omit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Active Azure subscription(s) with appropriate permissions**
  It's recommended to deploy these templates through a deployment pipeline associated to a service principal or managed identity with sufficient permissions over the the workload subscription (such as Owner or Role Based Access Control Administrator and Contributor). If deployed manually, the permissions below should be sufficient.

   - **Workload Subscription**
     - **Role Based Access Control Administrator**: Needed over the resource group to create the relevant role assignments
     - **Network Contributor**: Needed over the resource group to create virtual network and Private Endpoint resources
     - **Azure AI Account Owner**: Needed to create a cognitive services account and project
     - **Owner or Role Based Access Administrator**: Needed to assign RBAC to the required resources (Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, Storage)
     - **Azure AI User**: Needed to create and edit agents
     - **Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor**: Needed to write OpenAI responses API

1. **Register Resource Providers**

   ```shell
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices'
   ```

1. Sufficient quota for all resources in your target Azure region

1. Azure CLI installed and configured on your local workstation or deployment pipeline server

1. Terraform CLI version v1.13 or later on your local workstation or deployment pipeline server. This template requires the usage of both the AzureRm and AzApi Terraform providers.

1. An existing virtual network (VNet) in your Azure subscription with a subnet that includes the following private DNS Zones, created in the same resource group as the VNet:

- `privatelink.services.ai.azure.com`
- `privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com`
- `privatelink.openai.azure.com`

### Basic Private Deployment

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd reference_architectures/foundry_basic
   ```

1. **Login to your Azure subscription**

    ```shell
    az login
    ```

1. **Set your active subscription**

    ```shell
    az account set --subscription "<your_subscription_id>"
    ```

1. **Export the subscription ID as an environment variable to make it available to the AzureRM and AzAPI Terraform providers**

    ```shell
    export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
    ```

1. **Initialize Terraform**:

   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

1. **Review the plan**:

   ```shell
   terraform plan -var "foundry_subnet_id=<your_subnet_id>"
   ```

1. **Deploy the infrastructure**:

   ```shell
   terraform apply -var "foundry_subnet_id=<your_subnet_id>"
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Accessing Your AI Foundry

After deployment, you can access your AI Foundry environment within the private network through:

1. **Azure Portal**: Navigate to your Cognitive Services account
1. **AI Foundry Portal**: Use the web interface for model management
1. **Azure CLI**: Interact programmatically with your deployments
1. **SDKs**: Connect from your applications using Azure AI SDKs

### Monitoring and Observability

The configuration includes built-in monitoring:

- **Application Insights**: View telemetry, performance metrics, and traces
- **Log Analytics**: Query logs and create custom dashboards

Access monitoring dashboards through the Azure Portal or create custom queries in Log Analytics.

## Cost Considerations

This configuration is designed to be cost-effective for development workloads:

- **AI Models**: Uses standard pricing tiers with minimal capacity
- **Storage**: Log Analytics with 30-day retention
- **Compute**: No dedicated compute resources (serverless model endpoints)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Deployment Failures**:
   - Check model availability in your region
   - Verify quota limits for your subscription
   - Update model versions if outdated

1. **Permission Errors**:
   - Ensure your account has Contributor role on subscription/resource group
   - Check if Cognitive Services are available in your region

1. **Terraform Errors**:
   - Run `terraform validate` to check syntax
   - Update provider versions if needed
   - Check Azure CLI authentication with `az account show`

1. **Network Connectivity Issues**:
   - Ensure your VNet is properly configured
   - Ensure that the requests are routed through the private endpoints
   - Check NSG rules and route tables
   - Verify DNS settings for private endpoints
