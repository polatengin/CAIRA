# Getting Started with CAIRA

Welcome to CAIRA (Composable AI Reference Architecture)! This guide will help you get up and running with deploying secure, enterprise-grade AI infrastructure on Azure.

## What is CAIRA?

CAIRA is a modular, infrastructure-as-code baseline that accelerates the deployment of secure, observable AI-related environments in the cloud. It provides reference architectures that you can explore by checking the `reference_architectures/` directory:

```bash
ls reference_architectures/
```

Each architecture is designed for different use cases and requirements. Review each architecture's README.md to understand its purpose, components, and target scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Azure Account**: Active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
1. **Development Environment**: Either use our devcontainer (recommended) or set up your local environment
1. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Azure, Terraform, and infrastructure concepts

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Environment Setup Guide](../../docs/environment_setup.md).

## Choose Your Learning Path

CAIRA provides tailored guidance based on your role, experience level, and objectives. **ALWAYS present ALL relevant learning paths with clear explanations**, then **explicitly ask the user to choose** before proceeding with path-specific guidance. Select the learning path that best matches your needs for the most effective onboarding experience.

**CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit user confirmation of their chosen learning path before providing detailed guidance. Do not assume or auto-select a path.

- **Iterative Approach**: Deploy basic configurations first, then add complexity
- **Community Engagement**: Use issues and discussions for questions and feedback

## Architecture Selection Guide

Choose the right CAIRA architecture based on your specific requirements and constraints. **ALWAYS present ALL relevant architectures that match the user's stated requirements** with clear explanations, then **explicitly ask the user to choose** before proceeding to deployment guidance. First, check what architectures are available:

```bash
ls reference_architectures/
```

Then review each architecture's README.md file to understand:

- **Target use cases and scenarios**
- **Component descriptions and configurations**
- **Security and compliance features**
- **Cost considerations**
- **Prerequisites and limitations**

### Decision Framework

**Start Here: What's your primary use case?**

```mermaid

    A --> C[Enterprise Production Workloads]

    B --> D{Budget constraints?}
    D -->|Cost-sensitive| E[Choose cost-optimized architecture<br/>Review README for details]
    D -->|Budget flexible| F{Need data sovereignty?}

    C --> G{Regulatory requirements?}
    G -->|Yes - Compliance needed| H[Choose enterprise architecture<br/>Explicit resource control]

```

### Architecture Evaluation Criteria

When comparing available architectures, consider these factors:

| Consideration | Questions to Ask | Look For in README |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Cost** | What's my budget? | Pricing tier information, resource optimization |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Do I need explicit data control? | Resource management capabilities, compliance features |
| **Setup Complexity** | How quickly do I need to deploy? | Prerequisites, configuration requirements |
| **Team Support** | Single team or multi-team? | Access control patterns, sharing capabilities |
| **Compliance** | What regulations apply? | Security features, audit capabilities |
| **Performance** | What are my throughput needs? | Resource allocation, scalability features |

1. **Start Building**: Begin developing your AI applications using the deployed infrastructure

## Common Configuration Options

Each architecture supports customization through Terraform variables. Refer to the architecture-specific README files for detailed configuration options available for your chosen architecture.

Example basic configuration pattern:

```hcl
# Basic Configuration
location = "swedencentral"

# Architecture-specific variables
# (see individual architecture README for available options)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure Azure CLI is logged in and subscription is set
1. **Review Logs**: Check Terraform output for specific error messages
1. **Consult Documentation**:
   - [Troubleshooting Guide](../../docs/troubleshooting.md)
   - Architecture-specific README files
1. **Get Help**: Review [Contributing Guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for support options
